# Differences Between AngularJS and React Applications and Fixes

Based on the test failures, we need to fix several differences between the AngularJS and React applications to ensure they match both in functionality and appearance.

## UI and Styling Issues

1. **PhoneList UI Issues**
   - Need to ensure exact CSS matching for list items
   - Fix padding and margins in the phone list
   - Ensure thumbnails have the same size and display

2. **PhoneDetail UI Issues**
   - Fix layout of the phone detail page
   - Ensure specs list is formatted the same way
   - Ensure the main image is displayed correctly

3. **Image Handling**
   - Ensure images in the React app load and display the same as in Angular
   - Fix thumbnail clicking behavior

## Functionality Issues

1. **Search Functionality**
   - Ensure the search filter works the same in both applications
   - Fix CSS for the search input field

2. **Sorting Functionality**
   - Ensure sorting produces the same order of phones
   - Match the dropdown styling

3. **Phone Detail Navigation**
   - Fix image thumbnail selection 
   - Ensure specs are presented in the same order

## CSS and Animation Issues

1. **Animation Implementation**
   - Implement animations for page transitions
   - Match animation timing with Angular version

2. **CSS Structure**
   - Ensure CSS specificity matches the Angular app
   - Fix any Bootstrap layout differences
