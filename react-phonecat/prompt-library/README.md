# AngularJS to React AI Conversion

## General Task

### Task Description:
1. **Application Conversion:**
   - Convert the AngularJS [angular-phonecat](https://github.com/angular/angular-phonecat) application to React.
   - Ensure the React application replicates the functionality and is as close as possible to the original AngularJS version.
  
2. **Prompt Library Creation:**
   - Build a minimal and sufficient library of prompts that can help with automating the code transformation process.
   - These prompts should be designed to be reusable and focused on transforming AngularJS-specific constructs (directives, controllers, two-way data binding) into React-specific principles (components, states, props, etc.).
 
3. **Acceleration Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate how much the use of the prompt library accelerates the transformation process (e.g., percentage of time saved compared to manual conversion).
 
4. **Deliverables:**
   - The React version of the application.
   - The prompt library created for transforming AngularJS to React code.
   - A brief report detailing:
     - How the prompt library was created.
     - The acceleration (time saved) achieved using the library.
     - Challenges faced during the conversion process.

## Source Repository

The original AngularJS application to be converted is [angular-phonecat](https://github.com/angular/angular-phonecat), which is the official tutorial application for AngularJS.
