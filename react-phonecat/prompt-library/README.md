# AngularJS to React Conversion Prompt Library

> **Note:** This is a refined version of our prompt library. For a streamlined experience, please use the REFINED-*.md files. The original prompts have been kept for reference.

## Purpose

This prompt library provides a comprehensive set of instructions designed to assist developers in converting AngularJS applications to React. The prompts are intentionally general and can be applied to any AngularJS to React conversion project.

## Refined Prompt Library

We've streamlined our prompt library for better efficiency and clarity. The new refined prompts are:

1. [Components Conversion](REFINED-COMPONENTS.md)
2. [Services Conversion](REFINED-SERVICES.md)
3. [Templates Conversion](REFINED-TEMPLATES.md)
4. [Data Binding Conversion](REFINED-DATA-BINDING.md)
5. [Routing Conversion](REFINED-ROUTING.md)
6. [Animations Conversion](REFINED-ANIMATIONS.md)
7. [Project Structure Conversion](REFINED-PROJECT-STRUCTURE.md)
8. [Testing Conversion](REFINED-TESTING.md)

## How to Use This Library

1. **Identify what you need to convert**: Component, service, routing, etc.
2. **Find the appropriate prompt**: Use the corresponding prompt file for your conversion task
3. **Customize the prompt**: Add your specific AngularJS code to convert
4. **Apply the generated solution**: Adapt it to your specific project needs
5. **Test the converted code**: Ensure functionality matches the original

## Lessons Learned

We've documented our experience and insights gained during the conversion process in the [LESSONS_LEARNED.md](LESSONS_LEARNED.md) file. This includes:

- An overview of the conversion process
- Challenges we faced
- Best practices we identified
- Recommendations for future projects
- Evaluation of the prompt library's effectiveness

## Original Task Description

1. **Application Conversion:**
   - Convert the AngularJS [angular-phonecat](https://github.com/angular/angular-phonecat) application to React.
   - Ensure the React application replicates the functionality and is as close as possible to the original AngularJS version.
  
2. **Prompt Library Creation:**
   - Build a minimal and sufficient library of prompts for automating the code transformation process.
   - These prompts should be reusable and focused on transforming AngularJS-specific constructs into React-specific principles.
 
3. **Acceleration Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate how much the prompt library accelerates the transformation process.
   - Document time saved compared to manual conversion.
