# React PhoneCat Structure Refactoring

## Structure Simplification

As part of our refactoring process, we simplified the project structure to better align with React conventions while still maintaining similarities with the original AngularJS structure.

### Changes Made:

1. **Removed the `/app` directory**
   - Initially, we had created an `/app` directory to mirror the AngularJS structure more closely
   - We decided to simplify by keeping all source code in the standard React `/src` directory
   - This aligns with React best practices while still maintaining the component organization  

2. **Maintained component structure**
   - Kept the `/core`, `/phone-list`, and `/phone-detail` directories in their respective locations
   - Preserved the organization of services, utilities, and components
   - Import paths are now cleaner and more intuitive

3. **Assets organization**
   - All static assets remain in the `/public/assets` directory
   - This follows the React convention for public assets

## Current Structure

```
react-phonecat/
├── public/
│   ├── assets/
│   │   ├── img/
│   │   │   └── phones/  (phone images)
│   │   └── phones/     (phone data JSON files)
│   ├── index.html
│   └── manifest.json
└── src/
    ├── core/
    │   ├── checkmark/
    │   │   └── checkmark.js
    │   ├── phone/
    │   │   └── PhoneService.js
    │   └── index.js
    ├── phone-detail/
    │   ├── PhoneDetail.js
    │   └── PhoneDetail.css
    ├── phone-list/
    │   ├── PhoneList.js
    │   └── PhoneList.css
    ├── app.animations.js
    ├── app.animations.css
    ├── App.js
    ├── App.css
    └── index.js
```

This structure now properly follows React conventions while maintaining organizational similarity to the original AngularJS application.
