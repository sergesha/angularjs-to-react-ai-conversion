# Prompt: Initial React Project Setup for AngularJS Conversion

This prompt guides the initial setup of a React project intended as a conversion target for an existing AngularJS application.

**Goal:** Establish the foundational structure for the React conversion project.

**Steps:**

1.  **Create GitHub Repository:**
    *   Create a new empty repository on GitHub named `[Your-Project-Name]-react-conversion`.
    *   Initialize it with a `README.md` and a suitable `.gitignore` file (e.g., the standard Node.js gitignore).

2.  **Clone Locally:**
    *   Clone the newly created repository to your local development machine.

3.  **Add Original App as Submodule:**
    *   Navigate into the cloned repository directory.
    *   Add the original AngularJS application repository as a Git submodule:
        ```bash
        git submodule add <URL_of_AngularJS_Repo> original-angularjs-app
        git commit -m "Add original AngularJS application as submodule"
        ```
    *   This keeps the original source code easily accessible for reference within the same project structure.

4.  **Create React App Skeleton:**
    *   Navigate back to the root of your cloned repository.
    *   Use `create-react-app` (or Vite, or your preferred React setup tool) to generate the basic React application structure:
        ```bash
        npx create-react-app react-app
        # OR for Vite:
        # npm create vite@latest react-app -- --template react
        ```
    *   Move the contents generated inside the `react-app` directory to the project root, or keep it in a subdirectory if preferred. Adjust paths in subsequent steps accordingly.
    *   Install basic dependencies needed for routing and state management if not already included:
        ```bash
        cd react-app # or your project root if moved
        npm install react-router-dom # For routing
        # Add other core libraries like state management (e.g., Redux Toolkit, Zustand) if decided
        ```

5.  **Initial Commit:**
    *   Add all the newly generated React app files to Git.
    *   Make an initial commit for the React project skeleton:
        ```bash
        git add .
        git commit -m "Initialize React application structure"
        ```

**Expected Outcome:**

*   A local Git repository connected to a GitHub remote.
*   The repository contains the original AngularJS application code within a `original-angularjs-app` submodule.
*   A basic React application structure (e.g., generated by `create-react-app` or Vite) is present, ready for component development.
*   Core dependencies like routing are installed.
