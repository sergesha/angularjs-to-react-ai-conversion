# AngularJS-to-React Conversion Prompt Library

This library contains a collection of prompts designed to assist and accelerate the process of converting AngularJS applications to React. The prompts focus on breaking down the conversion into manageable steps and leveraging AI assistance for specific transformations.

## Purpose

The goal of this library is to:

1.  **Standardize** the conversion approach.
2.  **Automate** repetitive transformation tasks using AI prompts.
3.  **Guide** developers through specific AngularJS-to-React pattern conversions.
4.  **Improve** efficiency and reduce the manual effort required for migration.

## Available Prompts

*   **[Initial Project Setup](./PROJECT-SETUP.md):** Guides the initial setup of the target React project repository, including adding the original AngularJS source as a submodule.
*   **[Testing Setup with Playwright](./TESTING-SETUP-PLAYWRIGHT.md):** Details how to set up Playwright for visual regression testing, enabling side-by-side comparison and a "test-compare-fix-retest" workflow between the AngularJS and React applications.
*   *(More prompts will be added here as the conversion progresses, covering components, services, routing, data binding, etc.)*

## How to Use

1.  **Identify** the specific conversion task you need to perform (e.g., setting up the project, converting a controller, setting up testing).
2.  **Select** the relevant prompt from the list above.
3.  **Copy** the prompt content.
4.  **Paste** it into your AI assistant (like Gemini, ChatGPT, etc.).
5.  **Provide** any necessary context (e.g., specific code snippets from your AngularJS application).
6.  **Review and adapt** the AI-generated output for your specific needs.

## Contributing

Feel free to add new prompts or refine existing ones as you work through the conversion process. Ensure prompts are clear, focused, and reusable.
