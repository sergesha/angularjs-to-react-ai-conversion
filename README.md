# AngularJS to React AI Conversion

This project demonstrates the conversion of an AngularJS application to React using AI assistance, along with a reusable prompt library for future conversions.

## Project Overview

The project includes:

1. **Angular PhoneCat**: The original AngularJS application ([angular-phonecat](https://github.com/angular/angular-phonecat))
2. **React PhoneCat**: The converted React application (`react-phonecat/`)
3. **Prompt Library**: A collection of reusable prompts for AngularJS to React conversion (`prompt-library/`)
4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation of the conversion process (`docs/`)

## Key Features

- Complete conversion of AngularJS components to React functional components
- Matching visual appearance and animations
- Feature parity with identical user experience
- Comprehensive testing for visual and functional comparison
- Reusable prompt library for future conversions

## Prompt Library

The [prompt library](prompt-library/PROMPT-LIBRARY-INDEX.md) contains specialized prompts for different aspects of AngularJS to React conversion:

- Component transformation
- Service to hook/context conversion
- Template to JSX conversion
- Data binding transformation
- Routing conversion
- Animation implementation
- Project structure
- Testing strategies

## Documentation

The project includes comprehensive documentation:

- [Conversion Report](docs/CONVERSION-REPORT.md) - Detailed report on the conversion process
- [Testing Guide](docs/TESTING-GUIDE.md) - Guide for running and analyzing tests
- [Lessons Learned](docs/LESSONS_LEARNED.md) - Insights and recommendations from the conversion

## Getting Started

### Running the React Application

```bash
cd react-phonecat
npm install
npm start
# Open http://localhost:3000
```

### Running the AngularJS Application (for comparison)

```bash
cd angular-phonecat
npm install
npm start
# Open http://localhost:8000/app/
```

### Running Comparison Tests

```bash
cd react-phonecat
npm run test:comparison
npm run test:report  # View the test results
```

## Conversion Results

The conversion achieved:

1. **Functional Parity**: All features from the original application work identically
2. **Visual Matching**: The applications look visually identical
3. **Time Savings**: Approximately 71% reduction in conversion time using the prompt library
4. **Code Quality**: Modern React patterns and best practices
