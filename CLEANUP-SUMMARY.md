# Cleanup Summary

This PR removes unnecessary directories and files that shouldn't be tracked in Git:

1. **playwright-report/**: Test report files generated by Playwright testing framework
   - These are temporary files generated during test runs
   - Already listed in .gitignore but accidentally committed

2. **screenshots/**: Test comparison screenshots
   - Contains comparison images of Angular and React implementations
   - These are not necessary for the source code

3. **test-results/**: Test output files
   - Contains test execution metadata
   - Already listed in .gitignore but accidentally committed

These directories contain auto-generated files that should be recreated during development/testing rather than tracked in version control. This cleanup follows Git best practices and makes the repository more maintainable.
